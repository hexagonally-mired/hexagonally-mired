## Hi, I'm Mihir!

I'm a sophomore in High School, and I live in North Seattle

I'm a member of FRC Team [ChainLynx, #8248](https://github.com/ChainLynxRobotics)

See, at this point, I'd wish I had a cool mission statement, but I don't. I'm a human being, and I exist.

I'm obsessed with Linguistics, Critical Thought, and the Future of Computing.

Oh, and I'm a musician. I'm an absolutely insane musician, and, given a melody, maybe I can conjure your wildest dreams, or maybe I can't. Nobody's given me a melody yet :(.
